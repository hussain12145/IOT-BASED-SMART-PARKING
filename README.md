📋 Project Overview
This project is an RFID-based Smart Parking System using Arduino UNO. It integrates:

RFID (MFRC522) for user authentication,

IR sensors for slot occupancy detection,

Ultrasonic sensors for vehicle detection at entry and exit,

Servo motors for gate control,

ESP8266 for uploading data to the cloud (e.g., Google Sheets via Apps Script),

LEDs and Buzzer for feedback.

How It Works

1. RFID Scan: When a vehicle is at the gate, the driver scans their RFID card.

2. Validation: UID is checked against a list of authorized cards.

3. Vehicle Detection:

     If at Entry and authorized → check if slots are available.

     If at Exit and authorized → verify if UID was previously registered (i.e., the car entered).

4. Slot Assignment: An available slot (via IR sensors) is assigned.

5. Gate Control: Gates are opened/closed using servo motors.

6. ESP Communication: Status (ENTRY or EXIT), UID, available slots, and assigned slot are sent to ESP8266 via SoftwareSerial.

7. Feedback: LEDs and buzzer indicate success/failure visually and audibly.

##Notes
Distance for car detection: < 5cm from the ultrasonic sensor.

Empty slot logic: IR sensor returns HIGH when the slot is empty.

Gate movement: Smooth 0° ↔ 90° transition using servo.

##Setup Instructions
 
Connect all components as per the pin configuration.

Replace validUIDs[] with your RFID card UIDs.

Upload the code to the Arduino UNO.

Power the system and monitor the Serial output.
