## Project Overview

This project is an RFID-based Smart Parking System using Arduino UNO. It integrates several components to create an efficient and user-friendly parking solution. The system uses RFID technology for user authentication, sensors for detecting vehicle presence, and cloud communication for data management.

### Features

- **RFID Authentication**: Uses MFRC522 RFID module for secure user identification.
- **Slot Occupancy Detection**: Employs IR sensors to monitor parking slot availability.
- **Vehicle Detection**: Utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect vehicles at entry and exit points.
- **Gate Control**: Controls entry and exit gates with servo motors.
- **Cloud Data Management**: Connects to the internet via ESP8266 to upload parking data to Google Sheets.
- **User Feedback**: Provides real-time feedback through LEDs and buzzers.

## Getting Started

To set up the IOT-BASED-SMART-PARKING system, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Arduino IDE**: Download and install the Arduino IDE from [Arduino's official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- **Hardware**: Gather all the components listed above.
- **Libraries**: Install necessary libraries for RFID, ultrasonic sensors, and ESP8266 in the Arduino IDE.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hussain12145/IOT-BASED-SMART-PARKING.git
   cd IOT-BASED-SMART-PARKING
   ```

2. **Upload the Code**:
   Open the Arduino IDE and load the main code file from the repository. Select the correct board and port, then upload the code to the Arduino UNO.

3. **Connect Hardware**:
   Follow the schematic provided in the repository to connect all hardware components correctly.

4. **Set Up Cloud Communication**:
   Configure the ESP8266 settings to connect to your Wi-Fi network. Update the Google Sheets API key and other necessary parameters in the code.

5. **Test the System**:
   Power up the system and test the RFID authentication, vehicle detection, and cloud data upload functionalities.

### Using the System

- **Parking a Vehicle**: Scan the RFID tag at the entry gate. The system will check slot availability and open the gate if a slot is free.
- **Exiting the Parking**: Scan the RFID tag at the exit gate. The system will update the slot availability and open the gate.
